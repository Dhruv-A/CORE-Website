<h1 id="top-head">3. Basics</h1>
<h2 id="sub-head">3.1 Shell and Files</h2>
<p id="text-style">So far we've been working in the shell
   where we can see what we're running as soon as we type it.
   Another way to code is to create a new file in idle
   (File > New File) and then run after you type up code
   (Run > Run Module). You should always code in a file,
   however, we will explain most things in the shell so that
   you can instantly see the results.</p>
<hr id="art-div">
<h2 id="sub-head">3.2 Assigning Variables</h2>
<p id="text-style">Firstly, we will create a variable.
   Variables can be used to store information. Let's
   create a variable called 'name' and we will assign
   a name to it:</p>
<p id="code-style">name = 'Dhruv'</p>
<p id="text-style">Notice how you do not have to put
   quotations around the variable because it's not a string.
   Now, if we run this, and see what the value of
   the variable is:</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> name<br>Dhruv</p>
<p id="text-style">It returns the name.</p>
<hr id="art-div">

<h2 id="sub-head">3.3 Print</h2>

<p id="text-style">The print function outputs text:</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> print('Hello, World!')<br>Hello, World!</p>
<p id="text-style">Make sure the text inside is a string.</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> print(Hello)<br>Traceback
   (most recent call last):<br>&nbsp; File "&lt;pyshell#1>",
   line 1, in &lt;module&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print(Hello)<br>NameError:
   name 'Hello' is not defined</p>
<p id="text-style">This error is a result of not putting
   quotation marks around Hello. When we don't put in
   quotation marks, the code thinks we are looking for the
   variable Hello rather than the string. Additionally,
   you can print variables if you want!</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> print('Hello')<br>Hello</p>
<p id="text-style">Alternatively, you can store the
   name in a variable and print that out</p>
<p id="code-style">>>>name = 'Dhruv'<br>>>> print(name)<br>Dhruv</p>
<hr id="art-div">
<p id="sub-head">3.4 Input</p>
<p id="text-style">The input function asks for input from a user.</p>
<p id="text-style">You can add text inside the function to ask
   questions. Then I can type my input on that same line,
   let's say I'm answering the question that I'm asking:</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> input('What is your name?')<br>What
   is your name?Dhruv</p>
<p id="text-style">Notice how the output text and your input is
   connected. This does not look good and we typically add a
   space at the end of the string to fix it:</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> input('What is your name? ')<br>What
   is your name? Dhruv</p>
<p id="text-style">When you ask for an input, you should store your answer in a variable so that you can use it later on:</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> name = input('What is your name? ')<br>What
   is your name? Dhruv<br>>>>>  print(name)<br>Dhruv
   <br>>>>print('Hi ' + name)<br>Hi Dhruv</p>
<p id="text-style">Notice that we don't use quotation marks
   around variables, and that's how our code knows that
   it's a variable and not a string!</p>
<hr id="art-div">
<p id="sub-head">3.5 Integers and Floats</p>
<p id="text-style">An integer is a whole number.
   In python, if we want an integer, we just type in
   the number. For example, if I assign the number
   10 to num:</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> type(num)<br>&lt;class 'int'&gt;</p>
<p id="text-style">If we want decimals as well, we
   use something called a floating point number
   (float). For example, if I assign the number 10.1
   to num:</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> num = 10.1<br>&lt;class 'float'&gt;</p>
<p id="text-style">So, those are integers and floats. We
   will look at reasons why integers and floats are
   important later!</p>
<hr id="art-div">
<h2 id="sub-head">3.5 Type casting</h2>
<p id="text-style">Sometimes, we want to convert between
   integers and strings. We can only concatenate strings, therefore,
   in order to join a string and an integer, we need to convert
   the integer into a string first. Let's say we want to print
   the temperature:</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> temp = 20<br>
   print('It is ' + temp + ' degrees today!')<br>
   Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
   &emsp;File "&lt;pyshell#3>", line 1, in &lt;module><br>
   &emsp;&emsp;print('It is ' + temp + ' degrees today!')<br>
   TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str</p>
<p id="text-style">As explained, you need will get an error if
   you try to concatenate a string and an integer. To fix this
   we change the integer to a string:</p>
<p id="code-style">
   >>> temp = 20<br>
   &emsp;&emsp;print('It is ' + str(temp) + ' degrees today!')<br>
   It is 20 degrees today!
    </p>
<p id="text-style">Conversely, we sometimes want to convert strings
   to integers so that we can do some maths with them. This will be covered
   in the next article!</p>
