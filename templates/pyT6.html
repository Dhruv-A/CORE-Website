<h1 id="top-head">6. Booleans and Further Logic</h1>
<h2 id="sub-head">6.1 Booleans</h2>
<p id="text-style">Booleans can be thought of as variables
   that store two cases: true and false. It is returned by
   comparison operators, such as the if statements discussed above.
</p>
<p id="text-style">
   For example:<br>
   Is 4 less than 5? We know this is the case, in other words,
   it is true. We are able to compare such things in Python
   and it will return either true/false. This can be seen in the
   example below:
 </p>
 <p id="code-style">
   >>> 4 &lt; 5<br>
   True
 </p>
 <p id="text-style">
   We can see that the statement is true.<br>
   Conversely, try the opposite:
 </p>
 <p id="code-style">
   >>> 5 &lt; 4<br>
   False
 </p>
 <p id="text-style">We can see that Python outputs false.<br>
    Python uses this logic in if statements. If we go back to our
    soup flowchart
    <a id="link-style" href="/python/5">(from the
    previous article)</a>,
    we can view yes/no as the boolean outputs of
    True/False that the if statement outputs.<br><br>
    In <span id="code-style">if soup_time >= 10</span> we can say that
    <span id="code-style">soup_time >= 10</span> will either be
    <em>True</em> or <em>False</em>.<br><br>
    If the result of this comparison is true, we will stop cooking.
    In this way, we can see how Python uses boolean operations to make
    decisions in our comparison statements.</p>

<h2 id="sub-head">6.2 Logical Operators</h2>
<p id="text-style">Sometimes you want multiple conditions to be
    met before something happens in your code. You can do this using
    <strong>and</strong>. It checks whether both conditions are
    true and if either isn't, then it will output false.</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> True and True<br>
                   True<br>
                   >>> True and False<br>
                   False</p>
<p id="text-style">Let's apply this to our previous example.
   We only want to stop cooking our soup after 10 minutes but we
   also have to make sure we don't cook it for more than
   20 minutes. How do we apply this?</p>
<p id="code-style">soup_time = int(input('How long have you been cooking
    the soup?'))<br>
    if soup_time >= 10 and soup_time < 20:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;print('The soup is ready')<br>
    elif soup_time < 10:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;print('Keep cooking')<br>
    else:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;print('You've cooked it for too long!')
</p>
<p id="text-style">Additionally, we have two other operators for
  booleans: <em>or</em> and <em>not</em>. <em>or</em> checks if either condition
  is true. whereas <em>not</em> gives you the opposite of the boolean.</p>
<p id="code-style">>>> True or False<br>
                   True<br>
                   >>> True or True<br>
                   True<br>
                   >>> False or False<br>
                   False<br>
                   >>> not True<br>
                   False<br>
                   >>> not False<br>
                   True</p>
<p id="text-style">These are all very useful when you have
                   very specific criteria in your if statements.
                   Make sure you're comfortable with them!</p>
